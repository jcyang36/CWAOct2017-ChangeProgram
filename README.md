# CWAOct2017-ChangeProgram
By now, you should be comfortable with both writing programs and debugging programs (making a broken program work). This is a new type of assignment. Here we want to take a working program and change it to do something else.

 

Make the following program work for y = 9.5

 

public class ChangeProgram {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 int x, y, z;
 
 x = 5;
 y = 9;
 
 z = x * y;

 System.out.println("The product is " + z);
 }
}
